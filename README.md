# BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4.

Concept
	The player will basically be unstoppable. The focus will be around the flexibility of the combat system. The player should be able to destroy enemies with ease. All enemies will easily  be defeated with one touch of the player. The player will have special abilities that are active based on where the controllers are. This would include: arms crossed (  laser sword arms), arms out ( mega fists ), arms out ( Krilling discs ), one controller out one down ( ability to throw orb  orb can stick to enemies, if button pushed enemy comes into chock hold ), potential laser that can intersect to form op shopdawoop laser. These will only be activated if player pushes button to summon the blue ball in hand. Player should slowly unlock these abilities. Or be given then and just fights enemies that get bigger and badder but easy to defeat just too many to defeat. Just focus on making the player OP enough to destroy everything in an epic way.  Enemies may have multiple stages so that only certain attacks can damage them
